#### E-commercial Recommender Systems to Achieve Sustainability
## Project Overview
Recommender systems on e-commerce platforms are an important branch of recommender system applications. From the perspective of users, we typically consider whether the results recommended by a recommender system meet our expectations, as do most people who try to improve the platform to make more profit. However, from the standpoint ofthe item and the producer, it is not necessarily fair that items that are attractive to the user are given more exposure. In this project, we used one of the traditional recommender system models to assess whether the exposure of items recommended by the recommendation algorithm is fair in terms of sustainability. Subsequently, we improved the data pool and recommendation model to achieve a better trade-off between the accuracy of recommendations and sufficient exposure to sustainable products on e-commerce platforms.
